All relevant information and logic solving must be done in javascript
Webapp must be changed so that multiple instances can run
All 3 game web pages should now be in 1, with div visibility


TODO

New path to be taken:
when play button is clicked, go to /play

javascript of /play - First initialise all the variables, and a list of locations used
for loop of length of rounds, in which we cycle through each of the three stages - 
showing information - then showing guessing - then showing result

Final result/congratulations will happen after that for loop finishes - 
hide the rest of the divs and show the congrats - try and see if the confetti works

The javascript can send an ajax call to a online database running,  which can store player data
if accounts are made
