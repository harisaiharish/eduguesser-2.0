Please describe your project idea, What problem are you aiming to solve?

The lack of Geographical general knowledge is a problem even in first world countries, as many systems of education only prioritize
their own countries. Through our website Eduguesser, we aim to help educate users by giving them a fun & challenging learning environment,
where they can acquire vast resources of general knowledge revolving around the cultural, traditional and historical aspects
of Countries located all around the world.
Our project is an enjoyable interactive game designed to allow users to guess the location of a Country on the world map after
looking at certain key features of the country needed to be guessed. We have also implemented a scoring system which allows users
to compete against each other in pursuit of a higher score.

What technologies are you using to build your project?

We are using a database, with a RESTAPI(with CRUD) to control access. We created a backend for the website using
Flask in Python. HTML and CSS were used for WebPage Design for the FrontEnd. Extra Functionality
(like Interactive World Maps and Data Communication) was added using JavaScript. We used a multitude of External APIs
(like OpenStreetMap APIs)  to get data to render maps, and to geocode coordinates and locations

How would you describe your progress this far? Are you confident in being able to finish the project by Friday?
We have experienced slow but steady progress and have put in a lot of man-hours into the project. Our prototype
functionality is nearing completion, and soon we'll need to focus on the UI UX aspects of this project. We should be
able to complete the project by Friday.
